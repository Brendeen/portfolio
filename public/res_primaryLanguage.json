The concept of Battle Dice is a simple dice rolling game, where the user puts in some data like their name and blood type, and plays against a bot to see who gets a higher roll. The user can also specify what dice they want to play with, and view their old role data through the use of local storage. Battle Dice is taking over!!!",
